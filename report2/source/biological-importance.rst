Looking to its closest known homolog in Xenopus laevis (Q8JFY9_), its
likely the query sequence, B7Z7N4_, is a Poly(U)-specific
endoribonuclease. This enzyme participates in processing C and D
box-containing (box C/D) small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs).

This homolog has active sites at positions 162, 178, and 224. Both the
162 and 178 residues are histidines which are conserved in the query
sequence. Lysine is present at position 224 in the homolog, but this
is not seen in its alignment with the query sequence. Experimentation
has shown that mutations at these active sites and some nearby sites
results in the loss in catalytic activity and affinity for binding RNA
substrates. [GIOIA2005]_
